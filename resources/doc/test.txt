Setting up a db for testing seems quite awkward.
This is the procedure that worked.

bundle exec rake db:drop:all

bundle exec rake db:create
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:seed

or

bundle exec rake db:setup

bundle exec rake db:test:clone_structure


bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:seed db:test:prepare
